### Challenge
Borko puts three opaque cups onto the table next to each other (opening facing down) and a small ball under the leftmost cup. 
Then he swaps the cups:
    A. swap_typethe left and the middle cups
    B. swap_typethe middle and right cups
    3. swap_typethe left and right cups

### Input
The first and only line contains a string of at most 50 characters, Borko's moves.

### Output
Output the index of the cup under which the ball is: 
    1 if it is under the left cup, 
    2 if it is under the middle cup or 
    3 if it is under the right cup.

### Solution:
swaps = input() # Get the moves

ball_location = 1 # Initial position of the ball

for swap_type in swaps:
    if (swap_type == "A" and ball_location == 1):
        ball_location = 2

    elif (swap_type == "A" and ball_location == 2):
