# ðŸŽ„Christmas Coding Challenge 2024ðŸš€
Welcome to my **Christmas Coding Challenge 2024 repository**! 
This project is organized by the [Women Coding Community](https://womencodingcommunity.com/). 
With this challenge, I'm committing to solve a problem from [DMOJ: Modern Online Judge](https://dmoj.ca/) every day using <ins>python</ins> and the book "Learn to Code by Solving Problems" by Daniel Zingaro.

## ðŸ“‹ Challenge Goals
+ Solve one problem daily to improve my python programming skills
+ Build consistent coding habits
+ Expand my knowledge by using git hub
+ Improve my problem-solving skills
+ Deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures
+ Document each solution with explanations and, if relevant, alternative approaches or optimizations.
