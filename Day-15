### Challenge
Students would like to go on a school trip at the end of the year, but they need money to pay for it. To raise money, they have organized a brunch. To attend the brunch, a student in their first year pays $12, a student in their second year pays $10, a student in their third year pays $7, and a student in their fourth year pays $5.
Of all of the money raised at the brunch, 50 percent of it can be used to pay for the school trip (the other 50 percent is used to pay for the brunch itself).

### Input
The input consists of 10 test cases, with three lines per test case (30 lines in all). Here are the three lines for each test case:
• The first line contains the cost in dollars of the school trip; it's an integer between 50 and 50,000.
• The second line contains four numbers indicating the proportion of brunching students who are in first, second, third, and fourth year, respectively. There is a space between each pair of numbers. Each number is between 0 and 1, and their sum is 1 (for 100 percent).
• The third line contains integer n, the number of students attending the brunch. n is between 4 and 2,000.

NOTE: You cannot have less than a whole person (e.g., 1.8 people is the same as 1 person).Any missing or extra people should be removed from or added to the group with the highest percentage of attendees. There will always be exactly one group with the highest percentage of attendees.

### Output
For each test case: if the students need to raise more money for the school trip, output YES; otherwise, output NO."""

### Solution

for i in range(10):
    cost = int(input()) # read the the school trip cost
    proportion = input().split() # read the proportion of brunching students as a string and splited in a list of strings
    students = int(input()) # read the number of students attending the brunch
    percentage = []
    stud_per_year = []

    for j in range(len(proportion)):
        percentage.append(float(proportion[j])) # convert the strings in floats
        stud_per_year.append(int(percentage[j]*students)) # calculate the number of student per year 

    if sum(stud_per_year) < students:
        index = stud_per_year.index(max(stud_per_year)) # obtain the index of the group with the highest percentage of attendees
        stud_per_year[index] = stud_per_year[index] + (students - sum(stud_per_year)) # add the missing students

    raised = stud_per_year[0] * 12 + stud_per_year[1] * 10 + stud_per_year[2] * 7 + stud_per_year[3] * 5 # calculate the money raised at the brunch

    if raised/2 < cost:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
