### Challenge
Write a program to help Americans translate to Canadian. The rules for detecting American spelling are quite naive: 
* If the word has more than four letters and has a suffix consisting of a consonant followed by 'or', you may assume it is an American spelling
* That the equivalent Canadian spelling replaces the 'or' by 'our'. 
Note: you should treat the letter y as a vowel.

### Input
The user should type a word (not to exceed 64 letters)

### Output
If the word appears to use American spelling, the program should echo the Canadian spelling for the same word. 
If the word does not appear to use American spelling, it should be output without change. 
When the user types quit! the program should terminate.
"""

### Solution
word = '0' # Any word to enter the loop
while word != 'quit!':
    word = input()
    if len(word) > 4 and word[-2:] == 'or' and word[-3] not in 'aeiouy':
        word = word[:-2] + 'our'
        print(word) # Canadian spelling 
    elif word != 'quit!':
        print(word) # output any oder word than 'quit!'
