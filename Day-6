### Challenge
The password must meet all of the following requirements:
    - The password must be a string between 8 and 12 characters long (inclusive)
    - Every character is either a lowercase letter (a … z), uppercase letter (A … Z), or digit (0 … 9). 
    - It must contain at least three lowercase letters, at least two uppercase letters, and at least one digit.

### Input
The first and only line of input consists of a single string, the password.

### Output
Output a single string, either Valid if the password is valid, or Invalid otherwise.
"""

### Solution:

# Get the password
password = input()

# Start the counters of each feature
lowercase_sum = 0
uppercase_sum = 0
digit_sum = 0

# Sum of the number of times each character has been used
for letter in password:
    if letter.isupper():
        uppercase_sum += 1

    elif letter.islower():
        lowercase_sum += 1 

    elif letter.isdigit():
        digit_sum +=1

# Make sure that the password meets all of the requirements 
if (lowercase_sum >= 3) and (uppercase_sum >= 2) and (digit_sum >= 1) and len(password) >= 8 and len(password) <= 12:
    print("Valid")

else:
    print("Invalid")
