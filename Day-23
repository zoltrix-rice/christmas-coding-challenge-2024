""" ### Challenge
You would like to do some experiments in natural language processing. Natural language processing (NLP) involves using machines to recognize human languages.
Your first idea is to write a program that can distinguish English text from French text.
After some analysis, you have concluded that a very reasonable way of distinguishing these two languages is to compare the occurrences of the letters t and T to the occurrences of the letters s and S. Specifically:
    * if the given text has more t and T characters than s and S characters, we will say that it is (probably) English text;
    * if the given text has more s and S characters than t and T characters, we will say that it is (probably) French text;
    * if the number of t and T characters is the same as the number of s and S characters, we will say that it is (probably) French text.

### Input
The input will contain the number of text lines 'N' (greater than 0) followed by N lines of text, where each line has at least one character and no more than 100 characters.    

### Output
Your output will be one line. This line will either consist of the word 'English' (indicating the text is probably English) or 'French' (indicating the text is probably French)."""

### Solution

# Read input
numlines = int(input())
text = ""
for _ in range(numlines):
    text += input().lower()

# Determinate if the text is probably written english or french 
if text.count('t') > text.count('s'):
    print('English')
else:
    print('French ')
