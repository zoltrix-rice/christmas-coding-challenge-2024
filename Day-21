### Challenge
Two players, A and B, are playing a card game. The game starts with a deck of 52 cards. Player A takes a card from the deck, then player B takes a card from the deck, then player A, then player B, until there are no cards left in the deck.
There are 13 types of cards in the deck. These types are as follows: two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king, ace. There are four cards of each of these types in the deck. For example, there are four twos, four threes, and so on, all the way up to four aces. (That’s why there are 52 cards in the deck: 13 types times 4 cards per type.) A high card is a card that is a jack, queen, king, or ace.
When a player takes a high card, they may score some points. Here are the rules by which points are scored:
• If a player takes a jack, after which there is at least one card remaining in the deck, and the next card in the deck is not a high card, then the player scores 1 point.
• If a player takes a queen, after which there are at least two cards remaining in the deck, and neither of the next two cards in the deck is a high card, then the player scores 2 points.
• If a player takes a king, after which there are at least three cards remaining in the deck, and none of the next three cards in the deck is a high card, then the player scores 3 points.
• If a player takes an ace, after which there are at least four cards remaining in the deck, and none of the next four cards in the deck is a high card, then the player scores 4 points.
We’re asked to output information each time a player scores, as well as the total score for each player at the end of the game.

### Input
The input consists of 52 lines. Each line contains the type of a card in the deck. The lines are in the order that cards will be taken from the deck; that is, the first line is the first card taken from the deck, the second line is the second card taken, and so on.

### Output
Whenever a player scores, output the following line: Player p scores q point(s). where p is A for player A or B for player B, and q is the number of points that they just scored.

When the game ends, output the following two lines:
Player A: m point(s).
Player B: n point(s).
where m is the total score for player A and n is the total score for player B. """
