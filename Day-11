### Challenge
People who study epidemiology use models to analyze the spread of disease. In this problem, we use a simple model.
When a person has a disease, they infect exactly R other people but only on the very next day. No person is infected more than once. We want to determine when a total of more than P people have had the disease.

### Input
There are three lines of input. Each line contains one positive integer. The first line contains the value of P.
The second line contains N, the number of people who have the disease on Day Zero
The third line contains the value of R. Assume that P < 10^7; N <= P; R <= 10

### Output
Output the number of the first day on which the total number of people who have had the disease is greater than P.
"""

### Solution
P = int(input()) # Max. number of infected people to compare
N = int(input()) # number of people who have the disease on Day Zero
R = int(input()) # Number of people infected for one persone on Day One

sum_inf = N # Total number of people so far
count_day = 0 # day counter

while sum_inf <= P:
    sum_inf = sum_inf + N * R
    count_day += 1
    N = N * R   

print(count_day)
