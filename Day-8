### Challenge
 If we know the label of the wizard that the wand had obeyed before all duels and the outcomes of all N duels that were held one after another, answer the following questions:

    Which wizard did the wand obey after all N duels?
    How many different wizards did the wand obey?

### Input
The first line contains an uppercase letter of the English alphabet, the label of the wizard that the wand obeyed at the beginning.
The second line contains an integer number between 1 and 100, the number of duels from the text of the task.
In the next N rows there are two different uppercase letters of the English alphabet z1 and z2 separated by a space, whereas the wizard with the label z1 defeated the wizard with the label 
z2 in the duel.

### Output
In the first line print an uppercase letter of the English alphabet, answer to the first question from the task description.
In the second line print an integer number, answer to the second question from the task description.

### Solution

w = input() # wizard that the wand obeyed at the beginning
totalDuels = int(input()) # total number of duels

count = 1 # count the number of owners
owner = w

for i in range(totalDuels):
    wizard = input() # Results of the individual duels

    if owner == wizard[2]:
        owner = wizard[0]
        if owner != w:
            count += 1

print(owner) # The wizard to whom the Elder Wand obeys after all duels
print(count) # The number of wizards to whom the wand has obeyed
