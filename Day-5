### Challenge
Find out how satisfied C.C. is with the pizza she has received, given the following conditions:
    - C.C. will be absolutely satisfied if the pizza she gets has a width of 3 units and an extra-cheesiness of at least 95%
    - C.C. will be fairly satisfied if the pizza she gets has a width of 1 unit and an extra-cheesiness of at most 50%
    - C.C. will be very satisfied with any other pizza she receives.

### Input
- The first line of input will contain a single integer W(1<= W <= 3), denoting the width of the pizza C.C. receives.
- The second line of input will contain another integer C(0 <= C <= 100), representing the percentage of the pizza covered in extra cheese.

### Output
A single line containing C.C.'s satisfaction with her order in the form: "C.C. is M satisfied with her pizza."
Here, M is a string describing her satisfaction, which will be one of: absolutely, fairly or very.
"""

### Solution

# Width of the pizza
W = int(input())

# Percentage of the pizza covered in extra cheese
C = int(input())

# Define the satisfaction rate
if W == 3 and C >= 95:
    M = "absolutely"
elif W == 1 and C <= 50:
    M = "fairly"
else:
    M = "very"

print("C.C. is " + M + " satisfied with her pizza.")
