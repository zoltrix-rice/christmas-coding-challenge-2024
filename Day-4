### Challenge
In basketball, three plays score point: a three-point shot, two-point shot, and a one-point free throw.
You know the number of each of these types of scoring for the two teams: the Apples and the Bananas. 
Your job is to determine which team won, or if the game ended in a tie.

### Input: 
The first three lines of input describe the scoring of the Apples, and the next three lines of input describe the scoring of the Bananas.
For each team, the first line contains the number of successful 3-point shots, the second line contains the number of successful 2-point field goals, and the third line contains the number of successful 1-point free throws. Each number will be an integer between 0 and 100 inclusive.

### Output: 
The output will be a single character. If the Apples scored more points than the Bananas, output "A". 
If the Bananas scored more points than the Apples, output "B". Otherwise, output "T", to indicate a tie.

### Solution:

# Numer of successful three-point shot, two-point shot, and a one-point of the Apples
apple_threePoint = int(input()) 
apple_twoPoint = int(input()) 
apple_onePoint = int(input())

# Total score of the Apples:
apple_total = apple_threePoint * 3 + apple_twoPoint * 2 + apple_onePoint

# Numer of successful three-point shot, two-point shot, and a one-point of the Bananas
banana_threePoint = int(input()) 
banana_twoPoint = int(input()) 
banana_onePoint = int(input())

# Total score of the Bananas:
banana_total = banana_threePoint * 3 + banana_twoPoint * 2 + banana_onePoint

# Check which team won the game
if apple_total > banana_total:
    print("A") # The Apples won
elif banana_total > apple_total:
    print("B") # The Bananas won
else:
    print("T") # It was a tie
